Background:

- My name is Michael Rossi, I am a graduate of Quinnipiac University with my Bachelors in Finance. I am in the process of obtaining my Master's of Science in Business Analytics. Currently I am self employed as a high frequency/Day trader for equities and cryptocurrencies. 
- My career goals include possible employment at an investment bank or hedgefund. I would also like to work for myself and possibly start my own hedmefund. I would also like to develop a trading algorithm.
- I chose Fintech as a career path becuase it is a relatively new and unsaturated job market. This is a new space an industry making great headway compared to more traditional methods.
